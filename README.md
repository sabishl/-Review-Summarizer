Project Title:
Movie Review Summarizer: AI-Powered Film Insights

Overview:
This project is a web-based application designed to help users quickly understand the overall sentiment and key points of movie reviews. Instead of reading multiple long reviews, users can simply select a movie, and the system will generate a concise AI-powered summary.

The backend is built using Python Flask, while the frontend uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide an intuitive user experience. The Gemma 3:4B AI model (running locally via Ollama) processes user and critic reviews, extracting key insights and summarizing them in a readable format.
